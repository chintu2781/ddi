# 🚀 Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction (DDI Project)

---

## 📌 Project Title

**Deep Learning-Based Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Prediction Using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**

---

## 📖 Introduction

Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can lead to adverse effects and serious health risks. Predicting potential DDIs early during drug development or prescription is critical.  
This project leverages deep learning, specifically **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**, to predict the **presence** and **type** of interaction between two drugs.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

- **Healthcare Importance:** Adverse DDIs are a major cause of hospitalization.
- **AI for Healthcare:** Use machine learning to automate and enhance drug safety monitoring.
- **Speed:** Traditional experimental methods are slow and costly — AI speeds up DDI prediction.

---

## 📚 Literature Review

Previous methods mainly rely on:
- **Rule-based systems**
- **Similarity metrics (chemical, biological)**
- **Traditional machine learning models (SVMs, Random Forests)**

However, they often fail to capture the **complex graph structure** of drug relationships.  
Thus, **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** are emerging as a **state-of-the-art** solution for DDI prediction.

---

## 🔬 Methodology / Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - DrugBank dataset and merged DDI types.

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode drug names and interaction types using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder.

3. **Model Development**
   - Build a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** model.
   - Drugs are nodes; interactions are edges.

4. **Training**
   - Learn feature representations for drugs and predict interaction types.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Classification Report.

6. **Web Application**
   - Simple Flask web app to input two drug names and predict interaction type + probability.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- PyTorch Geometric
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Bootstrap 5 (Frontend)

---

## 📊 Results

- Achieved high accuracy in predicting DDI types.
- Top 3 predicted interaction types are shown with their confidence probabilities.
- Fast response web application interface.

---

## ✨ Uniqueness

- **GNN-based** approach instead of simple machine learning classifiers.
- **Multi-type DDI prediction** (not just binary "interaction/no interaction").
- **Web deployment** for real-world usage simulation.
- Easy retraining with organized modular codes.
